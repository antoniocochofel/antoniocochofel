                <p>Hi ! This is the page where i synthesize everything i did in a cool manner, while trying to seem a nice and easygoing guy. 
                    Which is actually true unless you hate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kxfj7O7Nhs">MEMES.</a> 
                    For some reason, i thought it was a good idea to go to take a law degree after high school. It was not. 
                    When i should have been studying i always found myself daydreaming, living in an imaginary movie set. It was time to change. 
                    I dropped out and got my degree in Sound and Image at Escola das Artes da Universidade Católica do Porto where i also was the President of the Students Association for 1 year and a half.
                    Soon after finishing school, i got a job as an assistant for a fashion filmmaker and, simultaneously, as a content creator at FC Porto. 
                    Meanwhile, i also participated in live coverage of music festivals and concerts in differente venues across the country, directed 2 music videos that got over 1 million plays on Youtube, and many other things that are not so spectacular, therefore, they do not deserve to be written in this beautiful bio.
                    I might be a nice guy but i am interested in using my skills for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbbuaIA3Ds">EVIL</a> so if you are a brand, an artist or any other kind of business hit me up at antonio.cochofel@gmail.com.
